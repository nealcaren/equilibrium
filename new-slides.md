## Slide 2: POllEVERYWEHERE

Surevey with four questions. Next four slides review the results.

____

## Slide 6:TITLE

Absence makes the heart grow fonder | Out of sight, out of mind
Practice makes perfect | You can’t teach an old dog new tricks
Strike while the iron is hot | Slow and steady wins the race
The early bird gets the worm | Good things come to those who wait
Be yourself | Fake it till you make it

____

## Slide 6: Our [something] observational skills are limited.


* We generalize from what we see.
* We remember stories, not base rates
* We explain outcomes after they happen
____

## Slide 6:  Same Society, Opposite Conclusions
Title: How can both be “true”?

* Two heads are better than one
* Too many cooks spoil the broth
> **Speaker Notes:**  “Both can happen — but under different conditions:
group size, incentives, power, task complexity, inequality.”
____

## Slide: This Is Where Research Methods Come In


* Define what we mean by concepts (friends, happiness, success)
* Specify who we’re talking about
* Compare systematically, not anecdotally
* Separate patterns from coincidences
* Identify when and for whom something is true


> **Speaker Notes:** Research methods don’t replace common sense — they discipline it.

## Slide: The Scientific Method 

| 1 | 2 | 3 |  4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|---|---|---|-------|---|---|---|
| Question | Literature | Hypothesis | Method | Data | Analyze | Share |



> **Speaker Notes:** Sociology follows the same general scientific method as other sciences, but, in terms of method, perhaps the most unique part is the way we collect and make sense of the data, so we are going to focus on that today. 

---
Yes — this is a smart reframing, and it actually **clarifies the intellectual move** you’re making. Right now, “you are the data” centers *technique*. Flipping it to **“What is a student?”** centers *ontology* — which is much more sociological.

Below is a clean rewrite that keeps your structure but pivots the emphasis from **students-as-objects** to **students-as-constructed social beings**, depending on the method.

---

##  Slide: What does it mean to be a student?

Sociology doesn’t give one answer.

Different research methods give *different versions* of the student.

>  **Speaker Notes:** Today’s argument is not “methods collect data differently.” It’s that **methods define what a student *is***. For the rest of class, we’ll look at the same social role — *student* — from multiple directions, and each one will tell a different story.

---

##  Slide: The Student, by Method 

| Method           | A “student” is…                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Survey           | A bundle of measurable traits       |
| Ethnography      | A set of practices and performances |
| Interview        | A self-interpreting narrator        |
| Existing Sources | A record or trace in institutions   |
| Experiment       | A case that reveals causal patterns |

> **Speaker Notes:** Notice: none of these are *wrong*. But none of them are *complete*. Each method answers a different version of the question:
> *What does it mean to be a student?*

---

##  Slide: The Scorecard 

By the end of class, you should be able to fill this in:

| Method | What It Gets Right | What It Misses |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Survey | | |
| Ethnography | | |
| Interview | | |
| Existing Sources | | |
| Experiment | | |

**Add one thing after each method.**

> **Speaker Notes:** Tell students to keep a mental (or written) scorecard. Call back to it: "Add one thing to your scorecard."

## Slide: POLLEVERYWHERE	


How much studying do you do?
---

## Slide: 
[After showing the results?] Why are reasons this might be wrong in studying studying behavior.

---

## Slide: 

* Comes from **one institution**, with its own academic culture and expectations
* Reflects the norms of **one course**, which may differ in workload, grading, or student composition
* Includes only students who **attend class**, excluding those who are less engaged or structurally constrained
* Overrepresents **traditional, full-time students**, while underrepresenting working students, parents, or commuters

---

## Slide: 
Convience sample [definition]
vs
simple random sample [definition]


--- 

## Slide:

* Asks about a socially valued behavior (“studying”), responses may reflect **normative expectations** rather than actual behavior
* Requires students to summarize an entire semester, answers rely on **imperfect recall**
* Leaves “studying” undefined, students may include very different activities
* Uses broad categories that compress variation, meaningful differences in effort are flattened


---

## Slide: 
**measurement problems** that affect validity.

* Diffrent things being caputred.
* The measure captures **students’ self-presentations and interpretations**, not just time spent studying.

---

## Slide:

* Capture **reported behavior**, not directly observed behavior
* Provide little insight into **meaning, motivation, or experience**
* Strip behavior from its **situational context** (course difficulty, stress, work schedules)
* Freeze dynamic processes into a **single snapshot**

----

## Slide:

Surveys are strong for identifying patterns, but weak for explaining how people experience and interpret their actions.
